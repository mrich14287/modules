# OCI Shared Resources Repo

This repository is meant to contain re-usable resources that may be called upon by multiple projects.  
Top level directories are provided for the various tools that are used by the team.  Current tools include:
1. terraform - used to create infrastructure resources
2. puppet - used to provide consistent configuration of infrastructure
3. oci-cli - used to perform operations on OCI resources that require more interaction than terraform can support
4. scripts - solutions developed in various scripting languages to perform specific tasks

Future additional resources may be made available as new tools are selected and our DevOps maturity increases.
